          Here's a brief list of some of the topics I learned or expanded upon
          in this project:

          Tasky is my version of a to-do list app if it were expanded to be more
          of a social network. What began as a simple weekend project evolved
          into a weeks long marathon to see how much I was capable of building
          without any tutorials using only what I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having previously worked with Node and Express, I decided to create
          backend functionality for Tasky that would allow for users to send
          tasks to one another and monitor their progress. Once comfortable
          building the backend API, I was excited to find out how easily I could
          create a search bar for user profiles with live results, live chat
          functionality, a notification system, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project served really well in strengthening and expanding upon my
          understanding of React. I used this opportunity to dabble with a bit
          of Redux where I could. This project also helped me gain a much better
          handle of Node.js and Express.
